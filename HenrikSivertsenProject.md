# Search in P3



Lige navngivningen har jeg luret:-): `P3_1400_1600_040806_001 = kanal (P3), tidspunkt (14-16), Ã¥r (04) og dato (06-08)`


# Search interval

We should work on P3 from july 2004 and rest of the year.

This corresponds to these files:

`/dr-dat/?/files/Batch??/Disc??/mp3_128kbps/P3_????_????_040[6789][0123][0-9]_???.mp3`

`/dr-dat/?/files/Batch??/Disc??/mp3_128kbps/P3_????_????_041[012][0123][0-9]_???.mp3`


# Convert MP3 to Wav

## Cut out a search-bit

`ffmpeg -ss 10 -t 6 -i input.mp3 output.wav`


# Direct search

`build/apps/sound-match needle.wav haystack.wav`

Needle and haystack must be of the same sampleRate.



# Index search

For reasons, ismir expects wav in 5512 Hz



2 steps. Build index and search

## Build index

Ismir is very single-threaded. However, indexes can be merged.

Use 8 cores to build the index with this script
```bash
ls -1 ~/dr-dat/?/files/Batch??/Disc??/mp3_128kbps/P3_????_????_040[6789][0123][0-9]_???.mp3 > files.list
ls -1 ~/dr-dat/?/files/Batch??/Disc??/mp3_128kbps/P3_????_????_041[012][0123][0-9]_???.mp3 >> files.list

split -l20 -d -a4 ../files.list 'split.'

mkdir db

ls -1 split.* | xargs -r -P8 -I{split}  ../build/apps/ismir_build_index -d db/{split}.index -f $PWD/{split}
```

## Resource consumption

Indexed 2470 mp3 files, each of 2 hours and ~116 MB.

The resulting index took up 6.1 GB, meaning about 2.5 MB per file. Or a reduction of 46:1.

Indexing such a file took 27 seconds, and used just one core.

The input files were available on SSHFS over a 1Gbit network.

When indexing MP3 files, a temporary WAV file is written in /tmp. If you run multiple indexings concurrently, this can stress your /tmp, especially when not used a SSD disk.


# Search result:

## Chunck1.mp3

When querying with MP3 files, the search file is automatically converted. This does, however make the query take a little longer.

```bash
ffmpeg -i ../chunk2.wav -ar 5512 ../chunck2.wav

It seems that the reported hits are about 3 seconds to late. So subtract 3 seconds from the results to get the actual hit.
